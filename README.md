# Password-Generator

Click a button to generate a password that is 8-128 characters in length with lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.

## Description

 This project's goal was to create a password of varying length and composed of random character combinations based on user's input.  The application should ask the user what length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and/or special characters) the user would like to use and validate each response, then generate a password based on user's selected criteria.
